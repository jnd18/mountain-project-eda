Since Mountain Project will only display 1000 routes at a time, 
and the rrg has over 2000 routes, I had to split the routes into 3 categories to download them.
I used the route rating to split up the data.

rrg1.csv contains all routes from 3rd to 5.9.
rrg2.csv contains all routes from 5.10a to 5.11d.
rrg3.csv contains all routes from 5.12a to 5.15d.

We actually end up with only 1966 total routes because the >2000 number counts the boulders, which I didn't end up including.
So I could have downloaded them in just two files, but oh well. There's three now.
